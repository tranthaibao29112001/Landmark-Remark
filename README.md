ReadMe: Overview of the "Landmark Remark" Application

I. Plan Management
  1. Prioritization: Focus on completing the highest priority user stories within the given time frame.
  2. See Current Location: Implement functionality to display the user's current location on the map.
  3. Save Note at Current Location: Enable users to save short notes at their current location.
  4. See Saved Notes: Develop the feature to view notes saved by the user at the location they were saved on the map.
  5. View Others' Notes: Allow users to see notes created by other users, displaying the location, text, and username.
  6. Search Functionality: Provide users with the ability to search for notes based on contained text or username.

II. Development Approach
  1. Android Kotlin: Utilize Kotlin for Android app development due to its modern features and interoperability with Kotlin.
  2. Jetpack Compose: Employ Jetpack Compose for building the user interface, leveraging its declarative UI toolkit.
  3. Firebase Integration: Integrate Firebase for backend services such as user authentication, data storage.
  4. Map Integration: Utilize Google Maps API for displaying maps and handling location-related functionalities.
  5. MVVM Architecture: Implement MVVM architecture to separate concerns and improve maintainability.
  6. Hilt Dagger: Use Hilt Dagger for dependency injection to simplify code and manage dependencies.

III. Time Allocation
  1. Understanding Requirements: 2 hours
  2. Design and Planning: 4 hours
  3. Implementation: 10 hours
  4. Core Features (See Current Location, Save Note, See Saved Notes): 6 hours
  5. Advanced Features (View Others' Notes, Edit Notes, Search Functionality, ....): 4 hours
  6. Testing and Debugging: 3 hours

IV. Improvements
  1. Login/Signup with Email using Firebase Authentication: Integrate Firebase Authentication to allow users to sign up and log in using their email addresses.
  2. Filter for User's Notes Only: Functionality Enhancement: Simplifies note management by focusing on the user's own contributions.
  3. Adding Pictures to Notes:  Enriches the user experience by allowing users to capture and share images along with their notes.
  4. Editing User Notes: Enable users to edit their existing notes, including text and attached pictures.
  5. Manual Location Adjustment: Implement functionality to allow users to manually change the location associated with their note.

V. Known Issues or Limitations
  1. Limited Search Functionality: Due to time constraints, the search functionality may be basic and not fully optimized.
  2. UI/UX Enhancements: The user interface may lack some refinements and could be further improved for better user experience.
  3. Scalability Considerations: The solution may not be optimized for handling a large number of users or extensive data, requiring further scalability enhancements in the future.
  4. Lack of Unit Tests: Unit tests have not been implemented due to time constraints. The absence of unit tests may lead to difficulties in identifying and resolving bugs during development and may impact the long-term maintainability of the codebase.
